# hello-world
just another repository

Hello, I'm Ellie. Just a small Computer Science minor trying to hang out with the big code crowds.
My goal for this site is to learn and write codes that can get me beneath the web. Or enough to make a living in the real world. I can't be a broke coder, well, can't I?
